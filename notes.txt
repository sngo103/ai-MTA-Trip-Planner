Note: All three of us have been working together via Microsoft LiveShare.
We are hosting on Daniel's PC, so most commits are in his name.

NEXT FIXES: 
-Apply current_state structure to __lt__ and heuristic methods in stop
-Figure out bug with __eq__ in Stop class

ISSUE:
-Heuristic requires access to state of algorithm


- write heuristics: 0.5 * number_of_stops + 0.5 * number_of_transfers (fewer is better)
    - least number of transfers
    - least number of stops
- ensure that the user does not need to enter the exact name of desired stops
    -use a drop-down GUI?


Things Completed:

Basic transfer-less A* search
Fully completed four-borough data set
Internal state tracking structure
