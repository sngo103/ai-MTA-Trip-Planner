Things to Do:

- build out linked list using stop order.csv
    -user input: station name 
        -program changes station name into stationID using data.csv (rename that)
        -stationID generates available starting trains using stop order.csv
        -transfer options are listed out in transfers.csv
- write heuristics: 0.5 * number_of_stops + 0.5 * number_of_transfers (fewer is better)
    - least number of transfers
    - least number of stops
- ensure that the user enters the exact name of desired stops.
- Write A* Algorithm without transfers
- Write A* Algorithm with transfers
