NEXT FIXES: 
-Apply current_state structure?
-Figure out bug with __eq__ (if necessary?)
-(Manually) fill in unlisted latitude and longitude values in stop_directory.csv

ISSUE:
-Import loops resulting from current_state structure


NEXT STEPS:
- Find a way to calculate stopsToGoal from different lines?
- ensure that the user does not need to enter the exact name of desired stops
    -there is presently no way to distinguish between stops with the same station name
        -ex: "7 Av" is a stop in Brooklyn on the F/G, a different Brooklyn stop on the B/Q, and a Manhattan stop on the B/D/E
        -the current method of relating user-inputted station names to stopIDs (mta.findStop) cannot distinguish between these different stations       
    -potential solution: use a drop-down GUI?


Things Completed:

Much improved A* search, supporting transfers and routes in both directions
Heuristic that takes into account latitude/longitude-based distance to the end stop, number of transfers made, and distance to the end stop (assuming that currentLine == endLine)
Four-borough data set (though a few latitude and longitude values need to be inputted)
